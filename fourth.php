                                <span class="firstcharacter">D</span>emand fluctuation, a competitive marketplace, and
                                unpredictable world trends require hoteliers to be more agile than ever before. But
                                implementing strategic solutions can provide your hotel with a firm foundation from
                                which to weather any storm. Let’s look at the top five operational challenges hotels are
                                facing now and—most importantly—how to best meet them.


                            </p>

                            <img class="col-md-6 img-fluid" width="50%" src="Blog/assets/img/post-slide-4.jpg" alt="" />
                            <h2>Staff Shortage</h2>
                            <p>
                                Short-staffed? Sadly, you’re in good company. In fact, according to the AHLA, 97% of
                                hotels reported shortages in 2022. The most popular recruitment incentives include wage
                                increases (90%), flexible scheduling (71%), and expanded benefits (43%). And yet the
                                problem persists.

                                Solution:

                                The above initiatives are helping hotels attract more staff. We also recommend
                                approaching recruitment as a marketing campaign by harnessing the powers of social media
                                and digital advertising. Offering recruitment bonuses to current staff will boost
                                word-of-mouth as well. Find out what attracted your staff to work at your hotel and what
                                they enjoy most about their job. Then use those testimonials in your outreach.

                                Even at the best of times, employee retention can be a challenge. Leverage existing
                                hotel technologies to streamline operations so you can continue to operate with a lean
                                staff while managing guest expectations. Online bookings, routine guest communications,
                                check-ins, housekeeping management, and accounting and reporting are key operational
                                tasks that can be automated by your property management system (PMS), saving hours of
                                time.
                            </p>
                            <h2>Unmet Guest Expectations</h2>
                            <p>
                                A recent report analyzed guest reviews and found that poor ratings were most commonly
                                related to dissatisfaction with cleanliness, dining options, and customer service.
                                Often, guests express disappointment because marketing material creates an unrealistic
                                expectation.

                                Solution:

                                It’s imperative to pinpoint pain points from your own customers’ reviews and leverage
                                post-stay surveys (which can be sent automatically upon check-out) to listen to your
                                guests and address any issues before they become reviews.

                                Hospitality Technology’s latest Customer Engagement Technology Study shows modern
                                travelers appreciate self-serve stay experiences with 73% embracing the use of mobile
                                devices to make reservations and interact with a hotel. Providing a mobile guest
                                experience—from your website and online bookings to check-in and communications—is key
                                to providing the kind of seamless customer service guests expect.

                                Mobile applications allow you to collect data too, via online bookings, contactless
                                check-in, and SMS messaging, for example. Be sure to collect as much data from your
                                guests as possible and maintain a healthy guest database in order to offer more
                                personalized experiences that exceed expectations. Try to determine why they are
                                traveling (business or pleasure, for example) and collect information like personal
                                preferences, interests and ancillary purchases. Collecting guest data can help you
                                identify your core guest demographics so you can determine what type of dining options,
                                amenities, or stay-and-play packages you should offer to satisfy your guests and meet
                                their needs.

                            <h2>Changing Travel Trends</h2>
                            <p>
                                Travel trends are ever-changing and subject to world events beyond our control. If the
                                pandemic taught us anything about hotels, it’s how agile the industry can be—and must
                                be. From no demand to an influx of demand, from technological advancements to luxury
                                staycations—hotel trends come and go. So just how can hotels keep up?

                                Solution:

                                During the pandemic, we learned how traditional hotel spaces can be turned on their
                                head. Hotel guestrooms were transformed to private dining rooms, meeting rooms were
                                rented out as private offices, and convention spaces were used as socially distanced
                                galleries—just to name a few examples! Hotels that were able to try new approaches came
                                out on top. And it’s this attitude that can be applied to ever-changing travel trends.

                                While some flexibility is required with your physical space (such as meeting demand for
                                co-working spaces), other demands can be met with your hotel software. If staycations
                                are trending, design stay-and-play deals that package activities with accommodation and
                                sell them together within your online booking software. Packages can be created and
                                changed up as needed to stay on the cutting edge. With flexible rate and package
                                management tools, you can be as creative and agile as you like.

                                Bring your offerings to market by building awareness via email campaigns, social media,
                                and digital advertising.
                            </p>
                            <h2>Disconnected Systems</h2>
                            <p>
                                Disconnected systems are a huge operational challenge for hotels (did we mention HUGE?).
                                Whether you’re using a paper guest ledger or have all the latest hospitality software
                                solutions, you’ll have huge headaches if your core systems aren’t integrated with each
                                other. Disconnected systems negatively impact efficiency, the guest experience and
                                revenue.

                                To illustrate, let’s say you introduced transactional emails—excellent! Every time
                                someone makes a booking or checks out of your hotel, they’ll receive an email with
                                relevant information about their stay. But this will only work if your email system is
                                integrated with your reservation software! If not, a process that can be easily
                                automated will instead remain a manual, time-consuming one.

                                Solution:

                                Fix disconnected systems with a well-integrated property management system. When
                                selecting additional software solutions (like guest messaging apps, mobile key
                                solutions, and revenue management systems, for example), ensure they will integrate with
                                your PMS. This way, your systems can talk directly to each other without you having to
                                act as the middleman. You’ll gain more time, provide a more seamless guest experience,
                                and create opportunities to generate more revenue.
