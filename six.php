                            <p>
                                <span class="firstcharacter">F</span>or hotels today, there is so much focus on online
                                conversions that the traditional voice channel is in danger of being overlooked. But
                                call inquiries are still key to direct sales. Eighty-three percent of US travelers would
                                rather book online, but that leaves approximately a fifth who would not.

                                In this digital era, front desk agents can’t be blamed for assuming that customers who
                                call have already done their research online—in many cases this is correct. However, not
                                all customers who call are ready to book. They may have questions about amenities,
                                policies, or rates and want to be reassured they are making the right choice.
                                Furthermore, customers ask tougher questions, armed with more knowledge than ever
                                gleaned from a multitude of online sources.

                                A phone call is a prime opportunity to make a direct booking and strengthen the customer
                                relationship, so staff need to handle phone enquiries with finesse. Here are six tips
                                for making the most of every call to increase conversions.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Display Your Property’s Phone Number Prominently on Your Website</h2>
                            <p>
                                When a property’s phone number is easily accessible, website visitors are more inclined
                                to call with questions (or to make a booking). They’re less likely to continue their
                                search elsewhere with a competitor or OTA.

                                Display both toll-free and local numbers on every page of your website and online
                                booking process. Including them in the page header and/or footer is unobtrusive, and
                                guests know to look for them there.

                                In addition, using click-to-call functionality for mobile may increase your inbound
                                calls by ten percent.

                                Make yourself as easy to reach as possible. Guests will give up if they have to send a
                                horse and messenger!
                            </p>
                            <h2>Empower Front Desk Staff</h2>
                            <p>
                                Knowledge inspires confidence, so keep the front desk team up to speed with policies,
                                rates, offers, and the reasons behind them. They can’t sell your guests on that holiday
                                package or special rate if they don’t know about it. This 2014 (but still very relevant)
                                article by Doug Kennedy of the Kennedy Training Network offers excellent advice about
                                how to quote pricing effectively, including tips for handling rate objections.
                                An automated property management system helps staff handle enquiries efficiently and
                                confidently.
                            </p>
                            <h2>Use Basic Sales Tactics </h2>
                            <p>
                                Proven reservation sales techniques will ensure you snag that booking. Receive callers
                                with a professional greeting and ask for their name. This allows you to build rapport by
                                using their name and look the customer up in your property management system, so you can
                                welcome back repeat guests.

                                Listen to the caller’s request. If they ask for information about the property or
                                location, describe features enthusiastically — don’t just list off amenities.

                                Find out their specific needs with polite questions like: “Is there something special
                                you are looking for?” This helps you promote relevant amenities and packages. For
                                example, if the caller is traveling with kids, they may like to know about your indoor
                                water slide and family offers. Customer details should be recorded in guest profiles to
                                aid in personalizing the guest experience and future offers.

                                Ask for the booking. You can create urgency by letting the customer know the discount is
                                only available for a short time or that rooms are filling up fast. Offer to secure the
                                reservation and lock in the rate by booking them now. Especially in the post-pandemic
                                era, customers are more likely to book if they know the cancellation policy allows them
                                to cancel free of charge within a certain time frame. Repeat back important information
                                like their phone number and email address to ensure you have them correctly.

                                When callers resist booking, find out why. If they object to the price, reiterating the
                                value of what’s included (parking, Wi-Fi, breakfast, etc.) or offering a cheaper room
                                can help. If the caller is looking for a specific amenity your property doesn’t have,
                                like an outdoor pool, promote alternatives. For example, “We don’t have a pool, but we
                                are an easy stroll from the beach and provide free beach towels.”

                                Tone of voice is key. Phone inquiries are often the first personal touchpoint a customer
                                has with a property and are a golden opportunity to make them feel welcome. A friendly
                                voice suggests much better customer service than an indifferent or inconvenienced one.

                                Avoid the hard sell. Nothing makes a customer want to dig in their heels like feeling
                                pressured. Too much pressure, and they’ll start to wonder what’s wrong with the
                                property. Accept that you can’t win them all.
                                Prepare for Difficult Questions
                                Ask staff about the questions they field, both common and challenging, and review
                                answers with them. Brainstorm responses together and draft up a list for reference.
                                Consider keeping this list by the desk, especially for new hires. It may help to role
                                play phone enquiries too.

                                If your staff has to transfer the caller to someone else, make sure the customer knows
                                who they’re being transferred to and why. You don’t want your guest gritting their teeth
                                on the other end of the line.
                            </p>
                            <h2>Record Customer Details</h2>
                            <p>
                                Even if a customer does not complete a booking, consider recording their information
                                (name, contact details, and relevant notes) in a customer profile within your property
                                management system or CRM. That way, if they call back later, you can provide
                                personalized customer service and find a solution that meets their needs more
                                efficiently. Offering to put them on a waitlist or let them know about future deals may
                                encourage them to give you their email address.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Evaluate and Reward</h2>
                            <p>
                                Put yourself in your customers’ shoes and make a reservation (or ask a friend to) so
                                that you can evaluate your property’s reservation process. Share feedback with your
                                team, discuss concerns, and implement goals. Don’t dwell only on the negative; good
                                performance should be rewarded with positive comments and encouragement. Consider staff
                                pizza nights or extra time off to provide additional incentive. Even before the pandemic
                                and the Great Resignation, 66 percent of workers said they’d leave if they weren’t
                                appreciated, so taking care of your staff this way is important.

                                While online bookings are central to hotel sales, the voice channel has the potential to
                                deliver your highest conversion rates and should not be overlooked. Every call should be
                                treated as a critical opportunity to establish a positive relationship that results in a
                                booking and, ultimately, a loyal guest.
